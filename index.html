            <h2 class="header">All About Sharks</h2>
            <p class="highlighting">Sharks are fascinating and ancient predators that have roamed the oceans for over 400 million years, making them older than dinosaurs. With more than 500 species, these creatures range from the tiny dwarf lantern shark, only a few inches long, to the massive whale shark, which can grow over 40 feet in length.
                Known for their keen senses, especially their ability to detect even the faintest traces of blood, sharks play a vital role in maintaining marine ecosystems by keeping fish populations healthy and balanced. Despite their reputation, many shark species are threatened due to overfishing and habitat loss, 
                highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect these essential ocean inhabitants.</p>

            <p id="SpecificSharks">The hammerhead shark stands out as the coolest shark with its uniquely shaped head, which not only gives it an unforgettable appearance but also enhances its sensory perception, allowing it to detect prey hidden in the sand. 
                It’s my favorite because of its distinct look and its role as an incredibly skilled hunter, showing off just how versatile and adaptable sharks can be!</p>

            <h2 class="header">Least Favorite Shark</h2>
            <img src="https://www.bluebaydivers.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Wobbegong-Shark-1024x685.jpg" alt="Angle Shark" width="244" height="164">
            <p id="SpecificSharks"> The angel shark is my least favorite because, despite its name, it doesn’t have the graceful look you'd expect. Instead, it has a flat, camouflaged body that hides in the sand to ambush prey, which feels more sneaky than angelic.
                 Its behavior and appearance make it an unusual member of the shark family, lacking the sleek, powerful image typical of sharks.</p>
